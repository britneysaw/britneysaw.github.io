## About Me
Hi, I’m Britney!  
I recently graduated from the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Data Science and Analytics. I’m a curious, motivated learner who values a good balance between fun and personal growth. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring musical instruments, and most recently, I've been training for a marathon. 

Right now, I’m excited to be working on two personal projects:
1. An interface to help people find car parks around Singapore, using the OneMap API developed by the Singapore Land Authority.
2. A Tableau dashboard visualizing my expenses during my six-month exchange program in the Netherlands.

Feel free to check back to track my progress!
