## About Me
Hi, I’m Britney!  
I recently graduated from the **National University of Singapore** with a degree in **Data Science and Analytics**. 

I’m a **motivated and curious** individual who values continuous growth and meaningful challenges. Currently, I'm working on: 
1. A web interface to help people find car parks around Singapore, using the OneMap API by the Singapore Land Authority.
2. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that transforms file content into presentation-ready slide decks.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring musical instruments, and most recently, I've been training for a marathon.

### Projects
#### Personal Travel Expenses Dashboard, Aug 2025
• Cleaned a 500+ line transaction dataset in Excel, including standardizing column/item names across languages (Dutch/English), formatting inconsistencies, and handling missing values and multi-currency transactions  
• Engineered additional fields (e.g., geographic data such as country/city identifiers, number of days spent) to enrich analysis  
• Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with maps, line charts, and Top-N breakdowns to analyze spending from a six-month exchange program in the Netherlands, uncovering insights on travel patterns and cost distribution by country, city, and category  

#### Fraud Detection in Telecom Networks using Graph Neural Networks, Feb 2025 - Apr 2025
• Designed a GNN-based fraud detection system on multi-million record telecom data during a collaborative 8-week hackathon, processing and engineered graph-based features to model user interactions and detect fraudulent behavior  
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection to identify fraud patterns across voice calls, SMS and application usage, which informed graph construction for modeling  
• Tuned ensemble models (CARE-GNN) to achieve high classification performance (AUC 0.9534) for fraud prediction  

#### Stochastic Modelling for Emergency Medical Services, 2024
• Applied stochastic processes to optimize emergency medical service (EMS) response times in a constrained geographic area, developing Markov chain models to simulate scenarios and identify optimal ambulance deployment strategies  

#### Carpark Demand Simulation at NUS, Aug 2023 – Nov 2023
• Led a 4-person team to build and containerize an interactive R Shiny application using Docker, integrating a discrete-event simulation model to optimize allocation across 6 NUS carparks  
• Created a simulation dashboard with data visualization to support agile operational decision-making for sudden surges in parking demand  
• Presented data-driven recommendations and translated technical insights into actionable parking system optimization strategies to non-technical stakeholders for decision making  
• Delivered a user-friendly and visually appealing UI, earning positive feedback from stakeholders  

#### Grammatical Acceptance Classfication (Machine Learning), Aug 2023 – Dec 2023
• Implemented an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline for NLP classification using Scikit-learn, collaborating with a cross-disciplinary team of computer engineering and data science students  
• Conducted data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to benchmark traditional ML models against transformer-based baselines
• Optimized Random Forest and SVM classifiers through hyperparameter tuning, achieving improved accuracy and F1-score over baseline models
