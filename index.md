## About Me
Hi, I’m Britney!  
I recently graduated from the **National University of Singapore** with a degree in **Data Science and Analytics**. 

I’m a **motivated and curious** individual who values continuous growth and meaningful challenges. Currently, I'm working on: 
1. A map to analyse car park availability in Singapore, using LTA DataMall and OneMap API.

    - <a href="assets/CO3211_Presentation.mp4" class="highlight-link">▶ Watch my project demo </a>


2. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that transforms file content into presentation-ready slide decks.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring musical instruments, and most recently, I've been training for a marathon.

### Projects
#### Personal Travel Expenses Dashboard, Jun 2025 - Aug 2025
• Cleaned a 500+ line multi-currency transaction data in Excel, resolving inconsistencies and handling missing values  
• Engineered additional fields (e.g., geographic data such as country/city identifiers, number of days spent) to enrich analysis  
• Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with maps, line charts, and Top-N breakdowns to analyze spending from a six-month exchange program in the Netherlands, uncovering insights on travel patterns and spending distribution by countries, cities, and categories

#### Fraud Detection in Telecom Networks using Graph Neural Networks, Feb 2025 - Apr 2025
• Designed a GNN-based fraud detection system on multi-million record telecom data during a collaborative 8-week hackathon  
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection to identify fraud patterns across voice calls, SMS and application usage, which informed graph construction for modeling  
• Created network visualizations with Pyvis to highlight user interactions and fraud patterns  
• Engineered graph-based features and trained ensemble models (CARE-GNN), achieving AUC 0.9534 for fraud prediction  
• Utilized Python libraries including pandas, numpy, networkx, PyTorch, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and shap for data processing, modeling, and visualization  

#### Stochastic Modelling for Emergency Medical Services, 2024
• Applied stochastic processes to optimize emergency medical service (EMS) response times in a constrained geographic area, developing Markov chain models to simulate scenarios and identify optimal ambulance deployment strategies
