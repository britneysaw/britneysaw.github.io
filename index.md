## About Me
Hi, I’m Britney!  
I recently graduated from the **National University of Singapore** with a degree in **Data Science and Analytics**. 

I’m a curious, motivated learner who values a balance between *fun* and *personal growth*. Right now, I'm working on: 
1. A Tableau dashboard visualizing expenses from my six-month exchange program in the Netherlands.
2. An interface to help people find car parks around Singapore.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring musical instruments, and most recently, I've been training for a marathon.

### Work Experience
#### Data Science Intern at Holmusk, Aug 2024 – May 2025
Holmusk is a healthcare analytics company specializing in real-world data-driven solutions.

Key contributions:
• Optimized over 100 Python and R functions to enhance SQL query performance and improve overall user experience on Holmusk’s analytics platform
• Automated and maintained technical documentation using shell scripting and the Sphinx library, boosting platform maintainability and updating the GitHub Wiki
• Refactored internal data pipelines using PySpark on Databricks to improve processing and scalability 
•  Streamlined package setup processes by reducing package setup time, boosting operational efficiency for development teams

### Projects
#### Fraud Detection in Telecom Networks using Graph Neural Networks, Feb 2025 - Apr 2025
• Designed a GNN-based fraud detection system on multi-million record telecom data during a collaborative 8-week hackathon, processing and engineered graph-based features to model user interactions and detect fraudulent behavior
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection to identify fraud patterns across voice calls, SMS and application usage, which informed graph construction for modeling
• Tuned ensemble models (CARE-GNN) to achieve high classification performance (AUC 0.9534) for fraud prediction

#### Carpark Demand Simulation at NUS, Aug 2023 – Nov 2023
• Led a 4-person team to build and containerize an interactive R Shiny application using Docker, integrating a discrete-event simulation model to optimize allocation across 6 NUS carparks
• Created a simulation dashboard with data visualization to support agile operational decision-making for sudden surges in parking demand
• Presented data-driven recommendations and translated technical insights into actionable parking system optimization strategies to non-technical stakeholders for decision making
• Delivered a user-friendly and visually appealing UI, earning positive feedback from stakeholders
